## Problem Description

Conventional equipment designed for detailed brain connectivity capture is often expensive and may not be readily accessible in various regions. However, devices that provide a rough approximation of brain connectivity are more widely accessible. This discrepancy poses a significant question: why can't we infer higher-resolution brain connectivity using more accessible devices currently available? In response to this challenge, our team, Super Idol, has developed an enhanced version of the AGSR-Net, Super-AGSR-Net. Our Super-AGSR-Net recognizes the importance of complex structural patterns in brain connectivity analysis and aims to better capture these intricacies for improved high-resolution predictions.

## Super AGSR-Net - Methodology

Our Super-AGSR-Net is the enhance version of the AGSR-Net. Inspired by the transformer model, we employ the attention network with the residual connection in Graph U-Net to capture varying node importance and long-range dependencies between non-neighbours. On the other hand, the discriminator’s residual connection helps counteract the vanishing gradients of the deep discriminator, allowing more efficient training. With an improved discriminator, Super-AGSR-Net’s generator receives better training feedback, encouraging it to produce a more accurate graph.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) ranges from 0.1281 to 0.1378. The model predicts HR samples with a level of accuracy, but there is still room for improvement. Pearson Correlation Coefficients (PCC) are consistently above 0.63, indicating a moderately strong positive correlation between the predicted HR value and the ground truth. This shows that the model successfully captures the general trend of the data. Jensen-Shannon Distance (JSD) remains around 0.28, showing that the predicted HR value partially diverged from the ground truth. Lastly, the average MAE with 3 different centrality types is very low, signifying that the model’s prediction captures ground truth’s network structure very well.

Our model achieved a Kaggle public score of 0.130581 (ranked 12th) and a private score of 0.152392 (ranked 14th).
